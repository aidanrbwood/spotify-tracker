Welcome to Aidan's Spotify Tracker:
The purpose of this project is to provide people with a way to collect their own analytics about their spotify usage
Spotify only allows people to view a small portion of their listening history at once, and doesn't allow viewing of most view songs/artists

This project requires python3 and is written for Linux/Mac systems
(Ideal use case is a low power always on system such as a raspberry pi)
To setup the project clone the project onto your machine and run setup.py
After completeing setup.py the project is good to use

To use the project run user_interface.py and select "Start Tracking" to start collectin analytics from your spotify
If you stop tracking at any time, don't worry the database of your analytics is persistent and will be added onto when you start tracking next time
